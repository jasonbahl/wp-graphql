# WPGraphQL Admin Tools (GraphiQL IDE)

[GraphiQL IDE](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) is a web based IDE interface for interacting 
with GraphQL APIs.

This implementation is tailored to work specifically with WPGraphQL. 

The React App has been architected in a way to allow 3rd party extensions to be created to "hook"
and "filter" the behavior of the application while sharing access to it's state.
